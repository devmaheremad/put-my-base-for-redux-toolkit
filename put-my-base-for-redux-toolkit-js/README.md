### - Introduction about Base for redux-toolkit code:

Redux toolkit is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
Redux is great, it does have a few shortcomings. First, configuring redux in an app seems complicated. Second, in addition to redux, a lot of other packages have to be installed to get redux to do something useful. Third, redux requires too much boilerplate code. That is, repeating the same pattern of code every time you had to add a functionality. As a solution to these problems, redux toolkit was created and serves as an abstraction over redux. It hides the difficult parts ensuring you have a good developer experience.
In this tutorial series on Redux Toolkit for beginners, we dive into the what, why and the how.
